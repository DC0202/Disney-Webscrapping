This project is a creative exploration into web scraping, specifically focused on gathering movie data related to Disney+ content. Since Disney+ does not offer a direct search feature for detailed movie information on its platform, this project leverages JustWatch as an intermediary. The process involves scraping data from JustWatch, which in turn links to specific Disney+ pages where the detailed information is available. This approach respects the legal boundaries of web scraping, adhering strictly to the principle that only publicly visible data is accessed and used.

## Difficulty Level 🤔

The challenge of this project was substantial. As an individual endeavor, it required a deep understanding of web scraping techniques, proficiency in navigating complex website structures, and the ability to handle dynamic content efficiently. The difficulty was further amplified by the need to interlink data from two different sources (JustWatch and Disney+), which involved sophisticated parsing and data alignment strategies.

## Data Fetched 📊

- 🎬 Movie titles
- 📝 Descriptions
- 🎨 Genres
- 📅 Release years
- ⭐ Ratings
- 🔗 Links to Disney+ for detailed information

## Legal Compliance ⚖️

This project strictly adheres to legal standards and ethical guidelines for web scraping. The data extracted is publicly available on the JustWatch platform, and the scraping process does not bypass any form of access control or encryption. The project's scope is limited to personal, non-commercial use and serves as an educational endeavor to understand and implement web scraping techniques.

## Technology Stack 💻

- 🐍 Python: Primary programming language.
- 🍲 Beautiful Soup: For parsing HTML and XML documents.
- 📡 Requests: For handling HTTP requests.
- 🤖 Selenium: For automating web browser interaction, crucial for dynamic content.

## Disclaimer 🚫

This project was developed as part of a coursework assignment for the 'Database Design' course. Its primary objective was to extract data related to Disney+ and analyze potential strategies for increasing subscription growth. It is strictly an educational endeavor, and there is no affiliation or endorsement from Disney or JustWatch. The project strictly adheres to legal and ethical standards of web scraping, focusing solely on publicly available data for non-commercial, academic purposes.
